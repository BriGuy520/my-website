          <p>
            Hey, 
          </p>
          <p>
            My name is Brian and I'm a web developer based out of Austin, TX. I'm entirely self taught and have been doing web development for a over a little over year now. 
            My main focus has been on Front End Development with React and Redux being my go to "framework". However, I've dabbled with other popular frameworks such
            as Angular and Vue.js. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I also do some backend and database work with Node.js being my go to backend langauge and MongoDB as go to database solution. Back end work is something I really enjoy doing and
            is something I want to focus more on in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've also worked with other langauges such as PHP and relational databases such as mySQL.
          </p>
