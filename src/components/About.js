    <p>
      I was born Chicago, IL and raised in the northern suburb of Libertyville, IL. I went to Libertyville High School and then to the Southern Illinois University-Carbondale. I fully admit, I was not ready for college at the time. Although I graduated with a degree in Business Management, I was still very immature and unsure of what it is that I truly wanted to do by the time I graduated in 2012. For a few years after college, I have worked for a number of great companies such as Whole Foods, Chipotle, Walgreens and STATS LLC. While I learned a great deal and met a ton of amazing people through these jobs, I've always had the desire to do something bigger, something that would allow me to reach my full potential. That's when I started to take an interest in programming.

      I started with learning the basics at codeacademy.com. I dabbled with html and css and thought that it would be easy to learn how to code. Boy was I wrong. The first language that I attempted was Javascript. Coming into the subject with very little experience, I struggled mightly. Just understanding the basics, like variables and functions, was extremely difficult to grasp. After struggling for a couple of months, I came across this new thing popping up all over the country called Coding Bootcamps.

      After looking into it more, I thought that I had found my answer. Go to a bootcamp, pay them tens of thousands of dollars and come out a professional developer in only 3 months. A very alluring prospect for a typical millenial like myself. So, after deciding on a bootcamp in Chicago, I reversed course and decided to learn Ruby. The reason for this was simple, that's what the bootcamp was going to teach me. Being so gung-ho about the prospect of landing a professional gig in 3 months, I spent hours trying to understand the concepts, but was still having a hard time grasping the material at codeacademy. Accompanied by the naive assumption that if I just kept pushing forward I would just get it and that I needed to learn as much as possible, as fast as possible in order to get a job. The problem with that was that the further I went and the more complex the concepts got the more lost I was.

      However, that didn't deter me from applying. It probably should have.

      After only a month of learning Ruby, I put in my application in for admittance to the bootcamp. Part of the application process was having a technical interview. To say I did poorly would be an understatement. I struggled with the most basic things like calling a function and producing a simple counting algorithm. In turn, I was rejected for admittance.

      Completely distraught about the rejection, I came to think that I didn't have what it takes to be a professional programmer. I pretty much gave up on the idea and started thinking of other things that I would be interested in. I even went back to school for a little bit with the intention of getting my Masters in Finance. Yeah, no.
